# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyses red Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine quality using publicly available data from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to identify the variables that make the highest contribution to wine quality and build a supervised machine learning multi-class classification model to predict wine quality scores. Interactive charts and visualisations are provided to support decision-making.
